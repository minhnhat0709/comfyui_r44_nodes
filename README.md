## Nodes
| Node | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Upscaler | Upscale an image in pixel space using an upscale model. You can select the upscale factor as well as the tile size |
| Iterative Upscale Factor | Determine the upcale factor depending on the index in the chain |
| Color Match | Match the color of an image to the color of a reference |
| Dynamic KSampler | Use multiple samplers during the diffusion process **This node is still a work in progress** |
| Mask Sampler | Target the diffusion to a masked region (*Inspired by Impact's SEGS detailer*) |
| Tiled Mask Sampler | Similar to the Mask Sampler, but with a latent tiling system |
| Image Overlay | Add an image on top of another, useful for watermarking |
| Image Resizer | Resize an image to a specific resolution, whilst keeping the aspect ratio (usually better when downscaling) |
| Image to Noise | Convert an image into latent noise |
| Image Enhance | Change the brightness, contrast, and saturation of an image in pixel space |
| Film Grain | Add film grain to an image in pixel space |
